# Security Policy
## Project Status

**Important Notice**: AniMathIO is transitioning into a maintenance phase with yearly or bi-yearly updates. Due to limited time and resources, active development has slowed down, and updates will primarily focus on critical security patches and bug fixes.

We encourage community contributions and will continue to review and merge pull requests that improve the security and stability of the project.

Only the latest version receives security updates and support.
